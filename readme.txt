WARNING! The E:D GPS is just a concept and was never designed for production usage. Please expect bugs/issues.

Before launching, please have "Elite: Dangerous" running as there is now file watcher at this time. There will be one eventually.

To launch the GPS, find & run "EdGPS.exe".

When prompted for a directory, please select the elite dangerous directory which contains all the "journal.*.log" files. You may find these inside your "Saved Games" folder on windows 8/10.
"Saved Games" is located under your windows account's home directory.

To turn off voice, change the value of "VoiceEnabled" inside "config.json" from "true" to "false".
